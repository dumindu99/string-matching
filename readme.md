# Data Structures & Algorithms III– SCS 2201
## String Matching Assignment

### About
This is a string-matching algorithm which oﬀer the user the ability 
to find a pattern in a text when the pattern contains “wild-cards”. This is developed using python 3
### Files
* algorithm.py - contains the string matching algorithm
* main.py - helper functions
* main.exe - standalone executable
* Tests - contains test files

### How to run
#### Method 1
In windows machines, you can simply run **main.exe** by double clicking it.
#### Method 2
This method works in any operating system
1. Install [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/) 
2. Make sure you set the path enviromental variable correctly (Windows) [(How to guid)](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#configuring-python)
3. run the **main.py** script
```
python main.py
```
then follow the screen instructions
### How write test files
**Tests** folder contains the test files. A test file can have any name. In a test file,
1. line - wild card
2. line - pattern
3. line - text

To run tests, run the programe by following above instructons. Enter 2 to load tests. Then select the test you want try.
